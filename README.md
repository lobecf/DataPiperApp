# README

In this application:
Frontend: Javascript React
Backend: Ruby on Rails

To access app from terminal:
- after cloning repo, cd into root directory
- $rails s
- $rails db:migrate
- $rails db:seed
- $npm start --prefix client

My approach:
- Creation of wireframe of UI
    - Understanding of flow of app
    - Understanding of model creation and correct associations
    - Reference wireframe as goal MVP

- Understanding and execution of MVP
    - Creation of RESTful API
    - Store existing job/role database (data is currently seeded)
    - Allow user to READ existing job/role
    - Creation of search input by role
    - Allow user to input his/her/their credentials for particular role

Further features of app:
- More robust UI - integration of back links
- Login/signup feature that allows for an admin (IE non engineer) to create or delete a job listing to/from DB
- Allow user to input resume(PDF, doc) to DB
